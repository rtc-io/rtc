# rtc

This is a package that will provide you a "one-stop shop" for building WebRTC applications.  It aggregates together a variety of packages (primarily from the [rtc.io](https://github.com/rtc-io) suite) to deliver a single package for building a WebRTC application.

## Getting Started

Probably the easiest way to get started with `RTC` is to take it for a testdrive using [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/dahuka/edit?html,css,js,output). This demo uses the minified JS file (and associated sourcemaps for debugging) from:

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rtc@latest/dist/rtc.min.js`

If you wish to use a specific version, then you can replace `latest` with the version number (from `3.0.1` onwards):

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rtc@3.4.0/dist/rtc.min.js`

### Package Managers FTW!

I'd recommend using a package manager if you aren't already and here are the relevant instructions for installing `RTC` from a number of popular options:

- __npm__: `npm install rtc --save`
- __bower__: `bower install rtc-io/rtc`

## Basic Usage

Establish a connection and render local and remote video feeds.

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>rtc.io simple conferencing</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/pure/0.5.0/pure-min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="layout.css">
</head>
<body onload="RTC()" class="pure-g">
    <div class="pure-u-1-5">
        <div id="l-video"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-u-4-5" id="r-video"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/rtc@latest/dist/rtc.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the [default configuration options](defaultconfig.js) are used for configuration, which are displayed below for informational purposes:

```js
// a default configuration that is used by the rtc package
module.exports = {
  // simple constraints for defaults
  constraints: {
    video: true,
    audio: true
  },

  // use the public switchboard for signalling
  signaller: 'https://switchboard.rtc.io',

  // no room is defined by default
  // rtc-quickconnect will autogenerate using a location.hash
  room: undefined,

  // specify ice servers or a generator function to create ice servers
  ice: [],

  // any data channels that we want to create for the conference
  // by default a chat channel is created, but other channels can be added also
  // additionally options can be supplied to customize the data channel config
  // see: <http://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#idl-def-RTCDataChannelInit>
  channels: {
    chat: true
  },

  // the selector that will be used to identify the localvideo container
  localContainer: '#l-video',

  // the selector that will be used to identify the remotevideo container
  remoteContainer: '#r-video',

  // should we atempt to load any plugins?
  plugins: [],

  // common options overrides that are used across rtc.io packages
  options: {}
};
```

## Diving Deeper

If there is a specific application that you are looking to build with [rtc.io](http://rtc.io/) feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc/issues/new) and outline a few of your requirements (video, audio, data, etc) and we can give you some advice.  In most cases, the following is a good rule of thumb for working our where you should jump in with rtc.io packages.

- Video and/or audio is crucial to my application and I haven't done a lot of work with [browserify](http://browserify.org)

  _Use the `rtc` distribution files from the CDN, and build your app_

- I feel comfortable using browserify, and find it a great way of building apps.

  _Configure your application using npm, and start by including the rtc package (`npm install --save rtc`).  If you need more flexibility than what is offered through this package, take something like [`rtc-quickconnect`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-quickconnect) for a spin._

- I am building something that isn't really media related, and just want to play with data channels.

  _You are going to want to use [`rtc-quickconnect`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-quickconnect) and we'd strongly recommend getting comfortable with browserify if you aren't already as it's going to make your life a lot easier._
